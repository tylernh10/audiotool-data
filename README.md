# audiotool-data
STAT 4185 Final Project

In this project, I scrape artist data from the online DAW/music sharing site audiotool.com to investigate and determine which features best predict follower count.

I look towards an artist's community involvement, metrics regarding their top track, and more in this prediction.

This project has been done in Python along Numpy, Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Scikit-Learn.
