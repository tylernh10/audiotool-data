# audiotool-data
STAT 4185 Final Project

In this project, I scrape artist data from the online DAW/music sharing site audiotool.com to investigate and determine which features best predict follower count.

I look towards an artist's community involvement, metrics regarding their top track, and more in this prediction.

This project has been done in Python along Numpy, Pandas, Requests, Beautiful Soup, and Scikit-Learn.

Note: in order to run the webscraping portion of the Notebook, you will need a valid audiotool username and password which can be entered as strings in the "info" dictionary. To bypass this, run starting from the cell that begins with the comment: "run from here to bypass scraping"\
Running this cell will populate the Pandas dataframe with data that has been previously scraped.
